# SQL-Project-Spring-2022
A SQL project from university.

We completed a project based on a business idea and demonstrated the following:

1) Created a conceptual model to satisfy the needs of the organization, allowing the insertion,
modification, and deletion of data without causing data integrity problems.

2) Created a logical model that describes the conceptual model developed above in as much detail
as possible. 

3) Included a data dictionary.

4) Wrote SQL queries.

Note: We chose MAMP (mostly) as our application to import the database and execute the SQL queries. It can also be duplicated with MYSQL and Oracle SQL. Please be aware of slight syntax differences if you wish to replicate our project with your chosen SQL Rdbms.
