### SQL Project ###

•	Developed a conceptual model that effectively met the organization's requirements, enabling seamless data insertion, modification, and deletion while maintaining data integrity.
•	Formulated a comprehensive logical model that elaborated on the previously created conceptual model, incorporating intricate details.
•	Integrated a comprehensive data dictionary to provide clear definitions and explanations for the project's data components.
•	Crafted SQL queries to interact with the project's data and carry out various operations.

Note: MAMP was chosen (mostly) as the application to import the database and execute the SQL queries. It can also be duplicated with MYSQL and Oracle SQL. Please be aware of slight syntax differences if you wish to replicate the project with your chosen SQL Rdbms.
