# SQL-Project-Spring-2022
A SQL project from university.

We completed a project based on a business idea and demonstrated the following:

1) Created a conceptual model to satisfy the needs of the organization, allowing the insertion,
modification, and deletion of data without causing data integrity problems.

2) Created a logical model that describes the conceptual model developed above in as much detail
as possible. This model include:
a. All entities and corresponding relationships between them marked with primary
keys and foreign key relationships.
b. All the attributes that each entity should include.

3. Supporting documentation including:
a. A data dictionary with the definitions of each entity and important attributes
that could otherwise be misinterpreted.
b. Description of the need for the database and what it should be able to do to be
considered successful.

4. Description of some of the tasks expected from the database, and related SQL queries
to get the answers to your question.

Note: We chose MAMP (mostly) as our application to import the database and execute the SQL queries. It can also be duplicated with MYSQL and Oracle SQL. Please be aware of slight syntax differences if you wish to replicate our project with your chosen SQL Rdbms.
